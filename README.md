# Mira

Automate app containerization.

## How to run locally

1.  ### Assumptions

- A working `Node` environment.

- An installation of the `yarn` package manager.

- Install the above if you have to.

2.  ### Running

- Install dependencies: `yarn install` or simply `yarn`.

- Create a `.env` file and add these values: `PORT=5000`.

- Start server: `node index.js` or `nodemon` if you have nodemon installed.

- To stop the server: `ctl + c`.

3. ### Testing

- The endpoint to use is `/`.

- The API will later be standardized and documented.
